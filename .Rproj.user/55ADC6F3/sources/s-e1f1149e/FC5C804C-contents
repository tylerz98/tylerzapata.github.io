knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


## R Markdown is really cool

In case you still aren't convinced, you can add codechunks in any of the following languages:

```{r}
names(knitr::knit_engines$get())
```

For example

```{python}
hw = "hello world"
hw[0:11]

```

But it gets even cooler!

### Reticulate package lets R and Python play together!

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)

hi<-"Hello"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
hi="world"
print(r.hi,hi) #access R-defined objects with r. 
```

```{R}
#R code chunk
cat(c(hi,py$hi)) #access Python-defined objects with py$
```


### Here's another example

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x=np.random.normal(0,1,50) #use numpy.random to take random samples
y=np.random.normal(0,1,50)

plt.scatter(x,y)
```

Let's use the data generated in python to create a ggplot plot in R:

```{R}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot()+geom_point(aes(py$x,py$y))
```
